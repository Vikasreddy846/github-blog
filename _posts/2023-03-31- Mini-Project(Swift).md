# Mini Project-Swift

## Coin Toss

## Overview

Coin Toss is a simple iOS application that simulates a coin flip with two possible outcomes: heads or tails. It was written in Swift. Coin tossing is frequently applied in games, decision-making processes, and other situations where a random selection is required. The application makes it easier to use and more convenient by offering a virtual coin in place of a physical coin.

### Skills that were used to develop the project

Swift programming language, which I was studying throughout the semester, was used to create this project. Some of the skills I acquired earlier this semester, such as using the Xcode development environment and declaring functions, classes, and enumerations, were helpful for developing the project. 

### Additional Skills that were used to develop the project

As I built the project, I also picked up a lot of new skills, including using the Xcode tool's storyboard feature to create the user interface and the delegation pattern, which is used to communicate between classes.

### Challenges

While building the project, I encountered  a lot of difficulties. I faced challenges to create the user interface when using the Swift UI user interface design tool in Xcode, so I used the storyboard feature to get around it. I ran into issues with the iOS simulator version while trying to start the application. The other significant challenge I ran into was Xcode's connection with Github.
