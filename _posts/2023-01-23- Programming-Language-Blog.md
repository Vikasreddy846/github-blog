Swift is the programming language I considered choosing.
I choose Swift because it is the programming language used in Apple platforms for the development of applications, and I anticipate that demand for Apple products will increase in the future, as will that for the Swift programming language.
I compared a few programming languages and found Swift to be more readable and understandable.Â
